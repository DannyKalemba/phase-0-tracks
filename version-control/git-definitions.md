# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a tool that allows you to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups in your code. It is useful because it allows multiple users to work on code and make sure its working before it is merged with the original. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of your project and you would use it because you are able to make changes and add features without losing the original. Once the features work you can merge them into the master.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

Commit is a save point for your files. A good commit message is one that explains the changes that were made with the commit.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when your current branch and branch you want to merge into have diverged. If you have commits in one branch that are not in the other you can get a merge conflict. For example if two people changed the same line in the same file where one person deleted it and the other decided to modify it you can get a merge conflict.
