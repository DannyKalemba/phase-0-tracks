Plan for learning jquery

I plan to find any guides or tutorials for beginners. I will start with with google and see what comes up. Finding examples and then trying those examples out on my own is what really helps me understand new topics. I will stop and test things i learn when I think trying it for myself will help me to better understand it. If I get too overwhelmed I will take a break.

I found that stopping and testing what I learned to be the most effective. It really helped me to understand the topic better when I'm able to apply the examples to my own problems.
