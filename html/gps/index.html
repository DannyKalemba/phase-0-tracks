<p>The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to make the html easier to read when looking at code. It makes it easier to find the different sections of the webpage in the html code when reading it. I see section and article as being the most useful semantic tag. The browser reads the html top to bottom so it loads the page in the order that the code is written. I learned about snippet's and how to write a snippet that can be used in sublime to make coding faster. I do think that I will create more snippets in the future. The most difficult concept in this challenge was the snippets. The snippets were difficult to read and understand. As I see more examples of snippets it will become easier to understand also if I write some of my own snippets</p>
